Windows
=======
This project can be built with the Code::Blocks nightly SVN

Install from here:

  http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/board,20.0.html

All you need is:

 - the codeblocks 7zip file
 - the mingwm10.dll file
 - the wxmsw28u_gcc_cb.dll file
 - an installation of GTK2+ development environment
 - the latest SVN of FUSE (NOT the Linux source release)

The top three reside in the same directory.

GTK+ 2.10.11 dev installer for Windows is available here:
